# chromium-headless-shell revision than the one installed by the global playwright.
#
# In Claude's remote cloud sandbox (CLAUDECODE=1 + CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE=true), outbound
# downloads are restricted, so playwright cannot auto-fetch the missing revision at
# runtime. We detect this environment and create symlinks from the installed revision
# to the path agent-browser's playwright-core expects.
#
# In devcontainer / GitHub Copilot sandboxes the download succeeds at runtime, so
# this fix is a no-op there (the binary already exists by the time we check).
